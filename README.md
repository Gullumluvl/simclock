Simclock
========

A simple R package to simulate phylogenies under relaxed clocks.

Prepare a timetree and use the `relaxed.tree` function to generate a phylogeny
with branch lengths in substitutions per site under the desired clock model.

The tree in substitutions per site can then be used with other software
packages (such as Evolver or Seq-Gen) to simulate sequence alignments.
